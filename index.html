By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. <br> You win the game by matching your total score to random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number. <br>The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. <br>Each time the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.</p></i>
